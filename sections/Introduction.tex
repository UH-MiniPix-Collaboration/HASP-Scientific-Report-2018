%Intro (date, time, and information of general flight.  Weather conditions.  Official flight time.  Float start time and date, along with termination time and date.  Impact location.  Did it all go well?
Braving through inclement weather, SORA 2.0 took off early on September 4, 2018 at 14:03 UTC along with 12 student payloads.  From Ft. Sumner Municipal Airport, the payloads flew for approximately 9 hours.  The flight terminated at 1:31 UTC the same day and then landed shortly after at 2:11 UTC about 60 miles southwest of Mt Graham, Arizona.

%Mission statement and objectives:
%SORA 2.0 was a continuation of SORA~\cite{SORA} but this time seeking to . . .
SORA 2.0 was a continuation flight to further develop and build upon the first SORA flight \cite{SORA}.  SORA's first flight in 2017 collected valuable information, yet another mission was necessary to confirm and add to the findings of the first SORA flight.  Once again SORA attempted to collect extremophile bacteria and spores that may reside 36 to 41 kilometers in the upper atmosphere.  For the radiation portion of SORA 2.0, a MiniPIX particle detector inside a custom built casing and coupled with a boron loaded scintillator was also flown.  This was to further study the surrounding radiation and attempt to measure neutrons in order to understand the possible effects on extremophiles.  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Past scientific questions:
% Are extremophiles present in the upper atmosphere at altitudes of 36 to 41 km?  If extremophiles are captured, can the SORA payload clean box container prevent sample contamination? Finally, can we collect data accurately enough to effectively study the effects of environmental radiation on extremophile organisms and spores.
 
%New scientific questions for SORA 2.0 from provisional application:
{\bf Scientific Questions}

The goals and objectives for SORA 2.0 are based on the following scientific questions: 
%
\begin{itemize}
	{\indentitem \item After confirming that microorganisms are present in the upper atmosphere in the first SORA mission, what extremophiles are present in the upper atmosphere at altitudes of 36 to 41 km?}
	{\indentitem \item Can Fluropore membrane filters (\SI{0.22}{\micro\meter}) passively capture microorganisms and spores in the upper atmosphere?}
	{\indentitem \item Are the new background control protocols sufficient to confirm microorganism and spore capture?} 
	{\indentitem \item Coupling a boron loaded scintillator to the MiniPIX, can it detect and measure neutrons? } 
	{\indentitem \item If there is a measured difference in the MiniPIX due to a neutron event, is that due to the scintillator?}
	{\indentitem \item Finally, with a deeper understanding of the MiniPIX after the first SORA mission, can SORA 2.0 collect more data to study cosmic radiation that microoganisms and spores experience on a daily basis? Specifically, can SORA 2.0 obtain useful information about the biological effectiveness of this radiation on bacteria through parameters such as linear energy transfer and dose equivalent?}
\end{itemize}
%

%Did we complete our objectives?  If yes, what were they again (insert here briefly).  
%The main goals for SORA were to once again collect extremophile organisms that reside in the upper atmosphere, study the effects of surrounding radiation on these organisms in the stratosphere and gather data pertaining to the environmental conditions in which these organisms reside~\cite{SORA}.  

%From our provisional application:
%The main goals for SORA are to collect extremophile organisms that reside in the upper atmosphere, study the effects of surrounding radiation on these organisms in the stratosphere and gather data pertaining to the environmental conditions in which these organisms reside [1]. More specically, SORA has two sets of main objectives, along with four additional objectives.

% INSERT CITATIONS HERE SINCE WE ARE TAKING FROM OUR OWN APPLICATION

\noindent {\bf Primary Objectives:}
	\begin{enumerate}

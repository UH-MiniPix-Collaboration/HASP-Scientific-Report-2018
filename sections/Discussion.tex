%include figure of downlinked data
%maybe some sort of figure from astrobiology?
%general discussion introduction, go in depth for other sections while referencing figures.
%since no biology results, we need to go into failure analyze mode and find out what can be done better in the future.

SORA 2.0 was safely recovered after flight.  With respects to the outer shell and build quality, all payload systems showed no damage of any kind.  The plastic insulation and reinforced openings aided in maintaining a stable operating temperature inside the payload walls.  Data and sample integrity both were retrieved successfully.  As seen in figure \ref{fig:integrationtemps}, data was downlinked and analyzed in a similar format without hiccups throughout the flight.  For astrobiology, samples were recovered safely and sent to be analyzed.  

Overall, the Kydex, flight-proven outershell structure served its purpose once again.  The impact protection, solid construction, and insulation properties of the shell allowed for uninterrupted experiments to take place in the harsh environments of the upper atmosphere.

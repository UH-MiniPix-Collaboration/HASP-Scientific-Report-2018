 The clean box, the collection containers and the tubing to the pump were all autoclaved to sterilize the components. 70\% ethanol solution was circulated through the pump to sterilize the internals. Everything used to assemble the system was then sprayed down with the ethanol solution. The  15 \% glycerol solution was poured into each container, the lid was sealed with epoxy and the tubing was inserted and epoxy sealed into the container lids. Each lid had two holes, one that led to the inside of the clean box to allow for pressure to be released from inside the container and outgassed  through the valve embedded in the box, while the other hole passed through the clean box lid to allow the tubing to connect to the pump or solenoid only in the case of the control tubing.The lid to the clean box was sealed with epoxy, the box was then mounted onto the payload and the tube from the control container was clamped to the dedicated control solenoid, while the sample collecting tube was passed through the other solenoid and connected to the pump.The tubing leading to the outside environment was secured with epoxy and gasket maker to secure the tubing in place. The filters used for the background samples were then attached to the walls of the payload. The solenoid clamping the tubing to the experiment container remained closed until float conditions are achieved.

The payload was successfully retrieved on September 6, 2018. The intact payload was shipped to the University of Houston and received on September 12, 2018. The clean box and background samples were removed and placed in cold storage at -20â—¦C. All equipment used in the filtration process was either autoclaved or taken from previously unopened sanitized packaging. The autoclaved, pre-sanitized items and the clean box were washed in a 70 % ethanol solution before they were placed inside a SterilGARD e3 Class II Biological Safety Cabinet. 
The control sample collection solution was vacuum filtered through a Fluropore membrane filter (13 mm; 0.22 micron) to collect specimens on the filter surface. Due to a lower glycerol volume, the experimental sample collection container was thoroughly swabbed with a Fluropore membrane filter. All filters were processed using the DNeasy PowerWater Kit by QIAGEN in preparation for 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. All post flight sanitation and sample and control filtration procedures took place under the supervision of Professor Donna Pattison from the Department of Biology and Biochemistry at The University of Houston.

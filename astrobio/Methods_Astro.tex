 The clean box, the collection containers and the tubing to the pump were all autoclaved to sterilize the components. 70\% ethanol solution was circulated through the pump to sterilize the internals. Everything used to assemble the system was then sprayed down with the ethanol solution. The  15 \% glycerol solution was poured into each container, the lid was sealed with epoxy and the tubing was inserted and epoxy sealed into the container lids. Each lid had two holes, one that led to the inside of the clean box to allow for pressure to be released from inside the container and outgassed  through the valve embedded in the box, while the other hole passed through the clean box lid to allow the tubing to connect to the pump or solenoid only in the case of the control tubing. The filters used for the background samples were then attached to the walls of the payload. The solenoid clamping the tubing to the experiment container remained closed until float conditions are achieved.

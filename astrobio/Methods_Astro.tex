 The clean box, the collection containers and the tubing to the pump were all autoclaved to sterilize the components. 70\% ethanol solution is circulated through the pump to sterilize the internals. Everything used to assemble the system is then sprayed down with the ethanol solution. The  15 \% glycerol solution was poured into each container, the lid was sealed with epoxy
 and the tubing was inserted and epoxy sealed into the container lids. Each lid had two holes, one that led to the inside of the clean box to allow for pressure to be released from inside the container and outgassed  through the valve embedded in the box, while the other hole passed through the clean box lid to allow the
 tubing to connect to the pump or solenoid only in the case of the control tubing. The filters used for the background samples were then attached to the walls of the payload. The tubing is then connected to the cylinder that controls the lid which exposes the tubing. The payload remained closed and sterilized until the time of flight at Fort Sumner. The servo lid was removed prior to flight to expose the tubing.

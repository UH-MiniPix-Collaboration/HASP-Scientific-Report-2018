The payload was successfully retrieved on September 6, 2018. The intact payload was shipped to the University of Houston and received on September 12, 2018. The clean box and background samples were removed and placed in cold storage at -20â—¦C. All equipment used in the filtration process was either autoclaved or taken from previously unopened sanitized packaging. The autoclaved, pre-sanitized items and the clean box were washed in a 70 % ethanol solution before they were placed inside a SterilGARD e3 Class II Biological Safety Cabinet. 
The control sample collection solution was vacuum filtered through a Fluropore membrane filter (13 mm; 0.22 micron) to collect specimens on the filter surface. Due to a lower glycerol volume, the experimental sample collection container was thoroughly swabbed with a Fluropore membrane filter. All filters were processed using the DNeasy PowerWater Kit by QIAGEN in preparation for 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. All post flight sanitation and sample and control filtration procedures took place under the supervision of Professor Donna Pattison from the Department of Biology and Biochemistry at The University of Houston.

\subsection{Astrobiology}
\label{sec:Astrobiology-Background}

Extremophiles thrive in physically and/or chemically extreme conditions, which are detrimental to most of life on Earth as we know it. These organisms and microbes have been found everywhere, from deep underwater volcano vents to buried ice lakes in Antarctica \cite{Extremophiles}. Conditions at altitudes of \SI{30}{\kilo\meter} to \SI{40}{\kilo\meter} are extreme in temperature, pressure and radiation. As shown in Table~\ref{tab:astrobiotable}, fungi and bacterial spores have previously been found in the stratosphere. Arguably, each successful collection expedition of at least \SI{30}{\kilo\meter} into the upper atmosphere provides information that could be useful in determining what life forms can exist outside of Earth's biosphere.

Today, the most common altitude for bacterial collection in the atmosphere occurs in the range of approximately \SIrange{10}{20}{\kilo\meter} above Earth's surface; very little data exists on microbiological samples captured in the stratosphere. Conditions at altitudes of \SIrange{30}{40}{\kilo\meter} are extreme in temperature, pressure and radiation. 



Our experiment is an attempt to further develop new and innovative techniques for capturing microorganisms in the upper atmosphere, as demonstrated during the LSU HASP 2011, 2012, 2013 flights~\cite{LSU} and by D.R. Canales~\cite{canales}. We used the KNF N84-4 commercial gas-sampling diaphragm vacuum pump to sample the air at approximately \SI{33}{\kilo\meter} above Earth's surface. The samples we collected are an important part to expanding our understanding of Earth's biosphere and further studies could provide more insight on how life can be distributed on Earth, and ultimately, through outer-space.

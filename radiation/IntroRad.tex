\subsubsection{Cosmic Radiation}
The study of the biological effects of cosmic radiation in space or near space environments is important for human space travel. Long term space travel necessarily requires humans and other biological specimens to be exposed to high levels of radiation for extended periods of time, so understanding amount of radiation exposure experienced from GCRs has important applications for flights to Mars and beyond. Also, the understanding of  cosmic rays specifically in Earth's atmosphere also has important applications to commercial airplane flights as they generally operate in a layer of the  atmosphere with far higher levels of radiation exposure than at the surface of Earth. 

Our goals for the radiation portion of our payload are two fold, to measure radiation levels at various layers in the atmosphere to determine its possible effect on microorganisms, and to test the operation of the MiniPIX particle detector in the extreme environment of the stratosphere for possible use in future missions. We ultimately seek to further previous research on utilizing Medipix/Timepix devices for measuring GCRs on stratospheric balloon flights~\cite{bexus}.

%Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) in space has been studied on

%primary GCRs such as high energy protons, alpha particles, and 
%heavy ions collide with atoms in the atmosphere they begin to shatter into secondary
%particles such as neutrons, pions, electrons and muons which causes a peak in 
%ionizing radiation at around \SI{18}{\kilo\meter}. This peak is known 
%as the Regener-Pfotzer Maximum\cite{regener} and shows that with increasing atmospheric density
% ionizing radiation increases until peaking high in the stratosphere and then decreases rapidly as you 
%reach the surface of the earth.

\subsubsection{Solar Radiation}
The ultraviolet (UV) spectrum is composed of UVC (\SIrange{200}{280}{\nano\meter}) with only \SI{0.5}{\percent} of the entire solar spectrum, 1.5\% of
UVB (\SIrange{280}{315}{\nano\meter}) and UVA (\SIrange{315}{400}{\nano\meter}), which contributes to \SI{6.3}{\percent}~\cite{uv_irradiance}. UVB and UVC are the main contributors in highly lethal solar radiation to microorganisms\cite{UVonDNA}. DNA is prone to high absorption levels at those wavelengths, often causing inactivation and mutation.  Therefore, understanding the exposure of microbes in to UV radiation is quite important.
